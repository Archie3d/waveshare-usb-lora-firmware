# Waveshare usb-lora custom firmware
Custom firmware to send and receive LoRa messages (particularly Meshtastic) using [Waveshare USB-to-LoRa module](https://github.com/Archie3d/waveshare-usb-lora).

## Programming
To flash the device with this firmware install [the bootloader](https://github.com/Archie3d/waveshare-usb-lora-bootloader) first. Then use [the CLI programmer](https://github.com/Archie3d/waveshare-usb-lora-programmer) to write the firmware.

## Communication interface
Once programmed, the module can be accessed via serial interface via the API described below.
The serial port must be configured as following:
| Parameter       | Value       |
|:----------------|:------------|
| Transfer rate   | 115200 baud |
| Data bits       | 8           |
| Stop bits       | 1           |
| Parity          | OFF         |
| HW flow control | OFF         |

## API

Binary communication protocol is used to talk to the device. Format of the messages is the same for both device to host and host to device communication.

All numbers are encoded as **little endian**, meaning that the least significant byte (LSB) is transmitted firts, and the most significant byte (MSB) is transmitted last.

### Binary message format
A message has the following format:
| # | Field   | Size | Value                                           |
|:--|:--------|:-----|:------------------------------------------------|
| 0 | 0xAA    | 1    | Message start byte                              |
| 1 | CMD     | 1    | Command/type                                    |
| 2 | SIZE    | 2    | Payload size in bytes as uint16                 |
| 3 | PAYLOAD | SIZE | Payload, message dependent                      |
| 4 | CRC16   | 2    | CRC as uint16 calculated over the fields [1..3] |

### Escaping

`0xAA` value is used to detect a message start in a data stream. This means that this value cannot be used anywhere else. For this reason all the fields of the message except the start byte are escaped.

The escape substitution is the following:
| Original byte | Escape sequence |
|:--------------|:----------------|
| `0xAA`        | `0x7D` `0x8A`   |
| `0x7D`        | `0x7D` `0x5D`   |

### CRC calculation

> :warning: CRC is calculated on **unescaped** data.

CRC is calculated on the entire unescaped message excluding the start byte (and the CRC itself, obviously).

The CRC-16 algorithm is the following:

#### CRC-16 in C
```c
uint16_t crc16(const uint8_t* data, size_t length)
{
    uint16_t crc = 0;

    for (size_t i = 0; i < length; i++) {
        uint16_t a = (crc >> 8) ^ data[i];
        crc = (a << 2) ^ (a << 1) ^ a ^ (crc << 8);
    }

    return crc;
}
```

#### CRC-16 in Python
```python
def crc16(data:bytes):
    crc = 0

    for b in data:
        a = (crc >> 8) ^ b
        crc = (a << 2) ^ (a << 1) ^ a ^ (crc << 8)
        crc = crc & 0xFFFF

    return crc
```

|:--------------|:------|:---------------------------------------------------|

| STDBY_RC      | 0x20  | The radio goes into STDBY_RC mode after Tx or Rx   |
| STDBY_XOSC_RX | 0x31  | The same as STDBY_XOSC with continuous RX after TX |

> `STDBY_XOSC_RX` Is a custom mode that gets translated to `STDBT_XOSC` for the SX1262 chip. This mode will switch the radio into conrinuous RX mode after the TX is done (time-out or packet received).
